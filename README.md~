Stanbol Entity Set Acquisition Widget is a contribution of Conatix UK Ltd. to Apache Stanbol for the early adapters program of IKS, http://www.iks-project.eu/ SESAW is specifically built to fetch the pages from wikipedia, get the title and the URL of the respective title and add them to entityhub of the Apache Stanbol. When they're added to the entityhub, the entities can be used as Named Entities. It can be used to add entities for a language for instance. Another use of it is to add a category or a set of categories as well as portals.
